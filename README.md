   <h2 align="center">Technologies 🚀</h2>

   <p align="center">
      These were the technologies used in this project, along with a summary of what I learned about each one: 
   </p>

   - **[HTML](https://html.com/)** is a hypertext markup language, which consists of a series of tags (or elements), to see a little more about HTML, [click here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp).
   - **[CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/ )** is the one who makes the stylization of your HTML, in other words, in it you can change the colors of the letters, backgrounds, spacing, decorations among many other possibilities, read more about, [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps), and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp).
   - **[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)** is a POO, who makes the application dynamic, and who, in this simple project, makes the connection with the client side (front-end), with the server side (back-end). See more about JavaScript [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction).
   - **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)**, allows you to create applications and tools on the server side (backend). Node has its package manager, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), it is very flexible and productive, API creations, among other benefits. You can read the [documentation](https://nodejs.org/pt-br/docs/), and about [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction).
   - **[Nunjucks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nunjucks)** is a [Template Engine](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html), which facilitates the creation of HTML pages, giving more performance, functionality and organization. Access the [documentation](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), and [see](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nunjucks).
   - **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)** is the database, suitable for small applications, operating for applications without the need for a server and is easy to use. See the [documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html), and [read](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-sqlite/).

   <h2 align="center">
   Challenges and Learnings along the way 🤯
   </h2>

   <p align="justify">
      This project was sensational for me, and I went through good and bad times, after all they are always part of our learning, which is continuous. The experience with the new technologies was great and satisfying, seeing your code giving results is a delight and a very pleasant feeling. <br>
       In this application the technologies mentioned above were used, of which not all of them worked previously (mainly those of back-end technology, such as Node.js and SQLite). <br>
      Among the technologies I had already worked on, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript (not yet very deep), I went back to learning, remembering and putting into practice several classes I already had in my luggage. <br>
      My biggest challenge, which I was able to overcome with ease, was in the moments when the back end started to be used, because I had never worked with server, localhost, Node, Nunjucks and SQLite, but it was sensational, and everything flowed through my mind.
      That experience was incredible, and I will definitely be on other occasions like this.
